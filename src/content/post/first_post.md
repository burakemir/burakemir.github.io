### a fresh start 

I had to redo these pages. Using [zola](https://getzola.com) now. Rust, lean, a theme I like, mathjax. My old blog posts are still at [bq9.blogspot.com](https://bq9.blogspot.com).

I wanted to like racket and pollen, but kept on forgetting everything absolutely everything.

All I want is to keep some standalone note pages, and some posts, with math and code. Goodness.

$e^{i\pi }+1=0$

```rust
trait Foo {
  fn foo(&Self) -> Bar
}
```

\AxiomC{$P$}
\AxiomC{$P\to Q$}
\RightLabel{$(\to_E)$}
\BinaryInfC{$Q$}
\end{prooftree}
