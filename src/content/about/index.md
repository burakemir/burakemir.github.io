### about me

I am Burak Emir. I have been passionate about programming languages ever since studying in Martin Odersky's group at EPFL. I live in Zurich, Switzerland with my wife and two daughters, and work at Google as *Alchemist of Happiness*.

### about this site

I am interested in systems, languages, types, logic where one can bridge theory and practice.
Occasionally I write things up. You could call it research, but outside any academic institution.

The posts here are a way to share the little I know on programming methods and programming 
language technology and related topics, like education or cybersecurity.

After finishing my thesis, I joined Google and worked as an engineer and occasionally manager on various systems and with a few teams. Engineering is more than writing code, but still it is fascinating to see how ideas from research on how to express programs slowly permeated the industry in the last 20 years.
