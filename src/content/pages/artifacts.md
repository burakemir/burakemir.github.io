Here are some snapshots from the journey [(dblp)](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/e/Emir:Burak):

* *Pattern Matching*. 

   * Burak Emir. [Object-oriented pattern matching.](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/109881). Thesis, EPFL Lausanne, 2007.
  * Burak Emir, Martin Odersky, John Williams. [Matching objects with patterns.](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/98468) ECOOP 2007.
  * Burak Emir, Qin Ma, Martin Odersky. [Translation Correctness for First-Order Object-Oriented Pattern Matching.](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/108817?ln=en) APLAS 2007

* *Constrained Polymorphism* (for lack of a better word). 
   * Burak Emir, Andrew Kennedy, Claudio Russo, Dachuan Yu. [Variance and Generalized Constraints for C# generics.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/variance-and-generalized-constraints-for-c-generics/) ECOOP 2006. I think variance annotations made it to C# 4.0 later.

 * *Symbolic Execution*
   * In 2010, I got funding for an internship to apply symbolic execution. This was ultimately unsuccessful, but we learned a few things. The intern was hired later.

 * *arrow-logo*
    * I did a few programming courses for kids using LOGO and wrote an interpreter [arrow-logo](https://github.com/google/arrow-logo) that runs in the browser. Some thoughts on [educational programming environments for kids](https://blog.burakemir.ch/2015/03/educational-programming-environments.html) on my old blog.

 * *Datalog and Logic Programming*.

    * I develope and maintain a language called [Mangle](https://github.com/google/mangle) and its implementation, open-sourced it (Nov 2022). More people need to know datalog.

### posts on the old blog

I used to post at [bq9.blogspot.com](https://bq9.blogspot.com) because it needed minimal effort but I just can't. Editing html with mathjax in this blogger interface is driving me nuts and drains
all my writing energy.

Here are some posts:
