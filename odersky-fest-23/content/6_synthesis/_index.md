Previous approaches that formalize Rust ownership, borrowing:
  * RustBelt (includes pointer arithmetic, unsafe) (Ralf Jung et al.)
  * Featherweight Rust (David Pearce)

Goal: 
  * isolate how ownership relates to linear logic / bunched implications
  * choose subset of Rust that is easily recognized 
  * canonical way to "translate away" flow (CPS)
