Mangle "Point-in-Time" is a kind of irregular news journal with information about Mangle as a language design and development project.


As the name suggests, "Point-in-Time" may contain outdated information. If you are looking for something more up-to-date, check out the Mangle documentation reachable via the [Mangle GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/mangle).

"Point-in-Time" is marked up in markdown format using `mdbook` and `mdbook-presentation-preprocessor` and published on the web. Therefore, it is possible to submit pull requests with corrections, comments, links to more updated information.

## What is in this issue

This first issue "Point-in-Time 01" contains background and overview of Mangle, prepared on the occasion on a talk I gave (virtually) at [Relational AI](https://relational.ai/) on 2023-05-12.

Mangle was open-sourced almost exactly 6 months ago (2022-11-25). It is far from complete and does have neither a complete spec, doc, and not even a roadmap to 1.0 release. This is supposed to change but comes with challenges: once certain design decisions are made, it is hard to change them.
