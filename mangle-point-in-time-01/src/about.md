## What is in this issue 01

Mangle was open-sourced almost exactly 6 months ago (2022-11-25). It is far from complete and we move slowly and deliberaly on design decisions. Also there is usage so you won't see big breaking changes. Some background can be found on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33756800) from Nov'22.

This issue was prepared on the occasion on a talk I gave (virtually) at [Relational AI](https://relational.ai/) on 2023-05-12, and an internal talk.

Abstract: 
Mangle is a query language based on datalog with extensions for aggregations. I will talk about some of the principles that guided the extensions like structured data and function calls, and how type-checking works. Throughout we give some examples from the cybersecurity domain. We conclude with an outlook on what will be added towards a v1.0 release.
