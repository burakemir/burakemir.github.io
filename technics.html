  <h1>Technics SL1200 MK5</h1>
  <p>I am selling my old Technics turntable. It's an awesome device and in excellent condition.</p>

  <p>SL-1200MK5 (released on 1 November 2002) has a silver finish like the MK2, increases the range of anti-skate settings from 03 grams-force (030 mN) to 06 grams-force (060 mN). It has a white LED target light (previous versions only had an incandescent bulb). Current MK5 models have a removable lid with magnets as opposed to the MK2 and MK3 removable hinged lid.

  <p>I am including an Ortofon Scratch system. </p>
  <p>Condition: Used, but very little</p>

  <p>Asking CHF 500</p>
